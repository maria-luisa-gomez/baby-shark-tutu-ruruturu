# baby-shark-tutu-ruruturu

## Introduction

The objetive of this project it's getting some hypothesis resolved working with a very messy and incomplete dataset (global shark attack file)

#### Hypothesis
1) Hypothesis: Has the number of shark attacks increased during the years?
2) Hypothesis: Activity vs Fatal. Are some activities riskier than others?
3) Hypothesis: Are some shark species more dangerous than others?

## Methods

- Cleaning dataset: working with nans and data aggregation 


## Libraries
numpy

pandas

seaborn

datetime

matplotlib.pyplot

regex

## Results
1) Hypothesis: Has the number of shark attacks increased during the years?

It seems it keeps incresing as year goes by and there's a significant difference between men and women although lately the number of cases for women has increased considerably (women in sports?)

2) Hypothesis: Activity vs Fatal. Are some activities riskier than others?

Swimming seems riskier than the rest and although there are more cases of shark attacks while people are surfing, they don't end up in death


3) Hypothesis: Are some shark species more dangerous than others?

White sharks seems to be the most dangerous species, maybe there are more number of white sharks in the world
